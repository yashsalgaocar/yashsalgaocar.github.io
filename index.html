            <p class="lead">My name is Yash Salgaocar, and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Southern California majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I spend most of my time as an undergraduate working as the Aerodynamics Lead for the USC Racing Formula SAE Team, designing, building, and testing the aero package of an open wheeled racecar for the Formula SAE Lincoln Competition. The main goal of the aerodynamics subteam is to increase the performance of the car by maximizing the aerodynamic downforce, while maintaining balance, and minimizing drag--resulting in higher cornering speeds with minimal impact on the straights. I particularly enjoy aerodynamics in Formula SAE because the regulations are fairly limited, allowing for limitless possibilities and creativity in design.

             <!--I am fascinated by automotive and aerospace aerodynamics, thermal systems, mechanical design, and product development. Outside of class, I play table tennis for USC’s varsity table tennis team, am an avid Formula 1 fan, and I also love to cook. Please feel free to email me at ysalgaoc@usc.edu </p>

            <p class="lead"> Three of the most important factors to consider when designing an aero package in FSAE is downforce, drag, and weight. In order guide design decisions for the aero package, I swept these three paramaters in a lap simulator to determine their affect on lap times. The plot shows an increase in the aero scaling factor (scaling downforce and drag equally) decreases lap times--designing for maximum downforce outweighs designing for aero efficiency (Lift/Drag). Additionally, the slope of the curves shows that a heavy, but high performance aero package would outweigh a light but poor performing aero package i.e. a 74% increase in aero package weight needs only a 12% increase in the aero scaling factor to produce the same lap time. FSAE tracks emphasize cornering over straight line speed, so the cars are almost always grip limited rather than power limited, so it would make sense that drag and vehicle mass are less important.

            <p class="lead"> The primary goal for the front wing for SCR19 is to reduce downforce sensitivity in dynamic conditions of pitch, roll, and yaw. Last year's front wing lost more than half of its downforce with a 1 inch drop in ride height, which was achieved in maximum braking conditions. The SCR19 front wing has a less cambered profile, allowing for a more even low pressure region distributed across the underside of the airfoil in ground effect. The resulting front wing has better flow attachment and is much less ride height sensitive:</p>

            <p class="lead">This year’s car features 13” magnesium wheels. These wheels maintain wheel stiffness while also reducing a unsprung mass by 3.5 lbm per wheel when compared to aluminum wheels featured last year. This lower unsprung mass increases overall acceleration of the vehicle and reduces wheel vibrations, providing more consistent tyre grip.

The system will be used for sanding composite structures for a project funded by Lockheed Martin. The tools all have metals plates and will be picked up by the robot using a solenoid core. The tool locks in place as shown in the animation above, so the system is fail-safe even when the solenoid is inactive. All the parts were designed using Solidworks and 3D printed.</p>

The preliminary design consisted of an insulated plywood frame with three layers of clear plexiglass. Plexiglass is a good insulator and is also clear, allowing for significant heating by radiation. Fluid simulations were done using Solidworks FlowSimulation and were based on environment conditions in Columbus, Ohio, in Spring. The simulations showed a temperature increase from 20F to 80F in around 9 minutes. </p>
