                <!-- <span class="text-muted">Will Catch Your Eye</span> -->
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> For my final project for a graduate class I took on biofluid dynamics (AME 536), I developed and validated a CFD model with experimental data from an MR Imaging study on velocity profiles in the caroid artery near the bifurcation zone. My simulation models blood as a non-Newtonian fluid, using the Carreau-Yasuda model to estimate viscosity as a function of shear rate. Additionally, this CFD model is time-dependent, with a specified pulsatile velocity for a full cardiac cycle specified from the experimental results at the inlet. The CFD model agreed with the MR Imaging results within reported one standard deviation of the MR Imaging experimental results, which was around 0.085 m/s. To learn more about the CFD model and the MR Imaging study, access my paper <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UtagxZ8HJYGtD3jDwp608i9RSYTXthVa/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.

            <p class="lead">

                I also made qualitative comparisons of the results of the CFD model with flow features at the carotid bifurcation available in literature. This image on the right compares velocity streamlines of the CFD model and those of an ex vivo experimental model that used hydrogen bubble flow
                visualization in a glass model of a carotid bifurcation. Major flow features like the flow separation at the bulb of the ICA and peak velocities near the inner walls of the ICA and ECA were captured in the model. Additionally, the flow follows the expected Poiseuille flow pattern in the CCA region and also shows the boundary layer effects at the walls of the carotid.

            <p class="lead"> Three key factors to consider when designing an aero package in Formula SAE is downforce, drag, and weight. In order guide design decisions for the aero package, I swept these three parameters in the Optimum Lap simulator to determine their effect on lap times. The plot shows an increase in the aero scaling factor (scaling downforce and drag equally) decreases lap times--designing for maximum downforce outweighs designing for aero efficiency (Lift/Drag). Additionally, a high performing aero package would outweigh a light but poor performing aero package i.e. a 74% increase in aero package weight needs only a 12% increase in the aero scaling factor to produce the same lap time. From these results it was clear that designing and aero package for maximum downforce would result in the most performance gains.

            <p class="lead"> The front wing for the SCR19 features several design changes outlined in Figure 2 to improve aerodynamic performance. A thinner, much less cambered mainplane performs much better than high-lift airfoils in ground effect, having less stall characteristics and ride height sensitivity. CFD Simulations in STAR CCM+ at 35 mph with a moving ground plane and rotating tires were used to simulate aerodynamic performance for downforce, drag, and ride height sensitivity shown in in Figures 3, 4, and 5. Additionally, having an adjustable third element shown in Figure 6 allowed for changes to aero-balance from 53% to 47% front bias to tune handling characteristics based on driver preference.</p>

            <p class="lead"> Since the rear wing of the vehicle is not in ground effect, it is much more challenging to find rear downforce. Driver feedback from SCR18 suggested that the vehicle lacked grip in the medium to high speed corners, suggesting a lack of rear downforce. To address this issue, the SCR19 rear wing has two extra elements and a more optimized wing configuration from iterating slot gaps and overlaps of the airfoils shown in Figure 8. The new rear wing produced 42% more downforce compared to the SCR 18 rear wing.</p>

The preliminary design consisted of an insulated plywood frame with three layers of clear plexiglass. Plexiglass is a good insulator and is also clear, allowing for significant heating by radiation. Fluid simulations were done using Solidworks FlowSimulation and were based on environment conditions in Columbus, Ohio, in Spring. The simulations showed a temperature increase from 20F to 80F in around 9 minutes. </p>
