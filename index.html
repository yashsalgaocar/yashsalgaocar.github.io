            <p class="lead">My name is Yash Salgaocar. I am an undergraduate student at the University of Southern California majoring in Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Applied Analytics. I will be graduating in May 2020. I am extremely passionate about automotive and aerospace aerodynamics, thermal systems, mechanical design, and product development. Outside of class, I play table tennis for USC’s varsity team, am an avid Formula 1 fan, and I also love to cook. Please feel free to email me at ysalgaoc@usc.edu </p>

            <p class="lead"> The primary goals for the front wing of the 2018 USC Formula SAE race car are to increase downforce, lower weight, and allow for a larger volume of airflow to the radiator for engine cooling.</p>
            <p class="lead"> The 2018 design of the front wing involves creating a curved mainplane. Approximately 30% of the mainplane performance is compromised by the nosecone--introducing a curvature will maximize effective wing area and result in more downforce.</p>
            <p class="lead"> One of the most important components on the aero package is the undertray/diffuser as it is one of the most efficient parts in producing downforce. The front wing plays an important role in allowing airflow to the undertray. The new designs also involve indentations in the section of the mainplane directly under the nosecone. This allows for more airflow to the undertray and diffuser.</p>
            <p class="lead"> Epler 423 and Selig 1223 airfoils with two and three elements are currently being tested in ANSYS Fluent (2-D). A ride height of 2” was selected based on 2-D ANSYS Fluent simulations.</p>

            <p class="lead">As a research assistant at the Center for Advanced Manufacturing this summer, I worked with a team of graduate students to design a low-cost 3D printed tool changing mechanism for the KUKA iiwa robotic arm, which is to be used for sanding composite structures for a project funded by Lockheed Martin. The tools all have metals plates and will be picked up by the robot using a solenoid core. The tool locks in place as shown in the animation above, so the system is fail-safe even if no current is flowing through the solenoid. All the parts were designed using Solidworks and 3D printed using the Ultimaker 3 Extended and Stratasys uPrint SE Plus 3D printers.</p>

            <p class="lead">As a product design engineer at Maya Culpa LLC, I remotely worked on designing a sustainable solar air heater, with the goal of providing heating and ventilation capabilities for controlled environment food production facilities. The preliminary design consisted of an insulated plywood frame with three layers of clear plexiglass. Plexiglass is a good insulator and is also clear, allowing for significant heating by radiation. Fluid simulations were done using Solidworks FlowSimulation and were based on environment conditions in Columbus, Ohio, in Spring. The simulations showed a temperature increase from 20F to 80F in around 9 minutes. </p>
