            <p class="lead">My name is Yash Salgaocar. I am an undergraduate student at the University of Southern California majoring in Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Applied Analytics. I will be graduating in May 2020. I am fascinated by automotive and aerospace aerodynamics, thermal systems, mechanical design, and product development. Outside of class, I play table tennis for USC’s varsity table tennis team, am an avid Formula 1 fan, and I also love to cook. Please feel free to email me at ysalgaoc@usc.edu </p>

            <p class="lead"> The primary goals for the front wing of the 2018 USC Formula SAE race car are to increase downforce, lower weight, and allow for a larger volume of airflow to the radiator for engine cooling. Approximately 30% of the mainplane performance is compromised by the nose cone, so I designed a curved mainplane, which will maximize effective wing area and result in more downforce. I also created an indentation in the section of the mainplane directly under the nose cone. This creates a gap between the nosecone and mainplane, allowing for more airflow to the undertray.</p>

            <p class="lead">As a research assistant at the Center for Advanced Manufacturing this summer, I worked with a team of graduate students on designing a low-cost 3D printed tool changing system for the KUKA iiwa robotic arm. The system will be used for sanding composite structures for a project funded by Lockheed Martin. The tools all have metals plates and will be picked up by the robot using a solenoid core. The tool locks in place as shown in the animation above, so the system is fail-safe even when the solenoid is inactive. All the parts were designed using Solidworks and 3D printed.</p>

            <p class="lead">As a product design engineer at HAPI, I remotely worked on designing a sustainable solar air heater, with the goal of providing heating and ventilation capabilities for controlled environment food production facilities. The preliminary design consisted of an insulated plywood frame with three layers of clear plexiglass. Plexiglass is a good insulator and is also clear, allowing for significant heating by radiation. Fluid simulations were done using Solidworks FlowSimulation and were based on environment conditions in Columbus, Ohio, in Spring. The simulations showed a temperature increase from 20F to 80F in around 9 minutes. </p>
