        Hello! My name is Yash Salgaocar. I am an undergraduate student at the University of Southern California majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I came to USC unsure of what I wanted to do, but I quickly found my place at the USC Racing Formula SAE Team and  to  Check out my LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yashvardhan-salgaocar-1a7635107/" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <div id="title"> Front Wing Designs for the 2018 USC Formula SAE race car </div>
    <p> The primary goals for the front wing of the 2018 USC Formula SAE race car are to increase downforce, lower weight, and allow for increased volume of airflow to the radiator for engine cooling.</p>
    <p> One of the design iterations of the front wing involved creating a curved rather than flat mainplane. Front wing downforce is a function of the surface area of the wing, so creating a curved surface increases the effective wing area.</p>
  <!--   <div id="paragraph3"> -->
    <p> One of the most important components on the aero package is the undertray/diffuser as it is one of the most efficient parts in producing downforce. The front wing plays an important role in allowing airflow to the undertray. The new designs also involve indentations in the section of the mainplane directly under the nosecone. This allows for more airflow to the undertray and diffuser.</p>

    Tool Changing Mechanism for the KUKA LBR iiwa Robot
    <div id="p2content"> <p> As a research assistant at the Center for Advanced Manufacturing this summer, I worked with a team of graduate students to design a low-cost 3D printed tool changing mechanism for the KUKA iiwa robotic arm, which is to be used for sanding composite structures for a project funded by Lockheed Martin. The tools all have metals plates and will be picked up by the robot using a solenoid core. The tool should not detatch from the robot in an instance when there is no current flowing through the solenoid for safety reasons, so the sytem locks in place by three groves and ridges that fasten in place. All the parts were designed using Solidworks and 3D printed using the Ultimaker 3 Extended and Stratasys uPrint SE Plus 3D printers.
